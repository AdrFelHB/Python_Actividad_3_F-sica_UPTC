"""
The orbit in space of one body around another, such as a planet around the Sun, need
not be circular. In general it takes the formof an ellipse, with the body sometimes closer
in and sometimes further out. If you are given the distance ℓ1 of closest approach that a
planet makes to the Sun, also called its perihelion, and its linear velocity v1 at perihelion,
then any other property of the orbit can be calculated from these two as follows.
   a) Kepler’s second law tells us that the distance ℓ2 and velocity v2 of the planet at
   its most distant point, or aphelion, satisfy ℓ2v2 = ℓ1v1. At the same time the total
   energy, kinetic plus gravitational, of a planet with velocity v and distance r from
   the Sun is given by...
